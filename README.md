# DevU-IntroductionToUnity

This repository was created to serve as a guideline for a series of tutorial classes
lectured to new members of Dev-U,  an extension project from Universidade Federal de 
Itajub√° aimed towards game development.

This tutorial was created with the idea of teaching the basics of Unity while at the same
time familiarizing newbies with version control (Git), an essential tool in the industry.
